# Project 3 - Data Visualization, Weather

## Proposal
Our project is centered around the analysis of ocean temperature data. By integrating data from multiple authoritative APIs, our goal is to construct a visual narrative that highlights the changes in ocean temperature and potential correlations of the frequency and intensity of severe weather events, as well the effects on oceanlife.
