# Project 3 - Data Visualization, Weather

## Proposal
Our project is centered around the analysis of ocean temperature data. By integrating data from multiple authoritative APIs, our goal is to construct a visual narrative that highlights the changes in ocean temperature and potential correlations of the frequency and intensity of severe weather events, as well the effects on oceanlife.

## Visualization Brainstorms
Baby seal populations
Storms - large scale tracking or isolating specific times/areas
Hurricanes - large scale tracking or isolating specific times/areas
Greenland Ice Melt

start with basics--show rises in global ocean temps, surface temps, CO2 emissions
OR we could go the opposite track and center the seals

then layer on top with the ideas mentioned above
layered line chart may work best for larger scale analysis
bubble chart for storm intensity
would love to incorporate gridded data to create heatmaps and/or focus on a specific area
time lapse animations could be cool?
drop down menus to select a specific event or set of events or time frame or region or

all vs ocean temps
