Alberth Nahas,

I apologize for the delay in processing your S2N data submission.  I am 
performing the preliminary appraisal and have a few questions and suggestions.  
This email, along with your responses will become part of the Archival 
Information Package (AIP) for your submission.  
Q1
What are the 2 possible "fertilizer_type(s)" in column 5,  which has a domain 
of [0, 1]?

Q2
Please provide a file with the full citations to the references listed in 
column 9 of the data file so future users can find and use them.  The 
references from the data file are listed below. 
ALFAM21
Badagliacca et al.12Carozzi et al.5
Gericke et al.14H�ni et al.9
Huo et al.13
Mart�nez-Lagos et al.11
Meade et al.17
Ni et al.16
Rodhe et al.15
Roelcke et al.18
Salazar et al.6
Salazar et al.7
Webb et al.2
Wolf et al.8
Yang et al.3
Yang et al.4

Q3
The abstract refers to the US, India and China and then goes on to say that 
the "The statistical model captures the spatial distribution of global NH3."
Are there any more specific coordinates for the data than global?

Q4
A preview graphic is included with all Archival Information Packages (AIP).  
Sampling locations are typically used but since you are indicating there is 
 world-wide distribution, a map is not that useful but a map will be used if 
you can not provide an image.  
Can you provide an image that would be useful for a future user to decide 
whether these data suite there purpose.  It could be a graph, plot, image in 
PNGor JPG formats?

Q5
We think the title can be improved to help future users find and use your 
data.  
There are a couple of options below, please change or modify,if they can be 
improved or made more accurate.  Or you can create a completely new title.  

We would like to change the title from:
AIR TEMPERATURE, pH, and others from 1990-01-01 to 2019-01-01

To:
Soil temperature, soil moisture, pH, ammonia and others from the NH3_STAT 
statistical model from 1990-01-01 to 2019-01-01

or
Ammonia (NH3) emissions characterization from agricultural soil sources from 
the NH3_STAT statistical model from 1990-01-01 to 2019-01-01

or other?
Q6

We would like to make a minor change to the abstract to clarify exactly what is 
in the AIP. Basically adding an introductory sentence. 

From:
Global ammonia (NH3) emissions into the atmosphere are projected to increase in 
the coming years with the increased use of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers and 
cultivation of nitrogen-fixing crops. A statistical model (NH3_STAT) is 
developed for characterizing atmospheric NH3 emissions from agricultural soil 
sources, and compared to the performance of other global and regional NH3 
models (e.g., EDGAR, MASAGE, MIX and U.S. EPA). The statistical model was 
developed by expressing a multiple linear regression equation between NH3 
emission and the physicochemical variables. The model was evaluated for 2012 
NH3 emissions. The results indicate that, in comparison to other data sets, the 
model provides a lower global NH3 estimate by 57%, (NH3_STAT: 13.9 Tg N yr-1; 
EDGAR: 33.0 Tg N yr-1). We also performed a region-based analysis (U.S., India, 
and China) using the NH3_STAT model. For the U.S., our model produces an 
estimate that is 143% higher in comparison to EPA. Meanwhile, the NH3_STAT 
model estimate for India shows NH3 emissions between -0.8 and 1.4 times lower 
when compared to other data sets. A lower estimate is also seen for China, 
where the model estimates NH3 emissions 0.4-5 times lower than other datasets. 
The difference in the global estimates is attributed to the lower estimates in 
major agricultural countries like China and India. The statistical model 
captures the spatial distribution of global NH3 emissions by utilizing a 
simplified approach compared to other readily available datasets. Moreover, the 
NH3_STAT model provides an opportunity to predict future NH3 emissions in a 
changing world.
