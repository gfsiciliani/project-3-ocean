Hi Lauren,

Good catch!  Let's match it to the metadata and use the -58.  That 
covers our research area so they can match it with other projects
 we are doing which may be of interest to them.

I've attached a photo of a fur seal pup - they are so dang cute! 

Let me know if you have any questions, and thanks for your help!!

Hi Stephanie,
You mentioned in the comments that you would like to send me a picture 
to include as a browse graphic. Also, I was looking at your metadata 
and you have the North Boundary as -58, but in the S2NCEI form you 
entered -53.4. Which North Boundary would you prefer I use?
Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you,
Lauren

Hi Lauren - thank you!!

I will update and publish the InPort pages after I send this email to you - 
I'll email back confirmation when it's done, which should be quick.

Yes, please add the CCAMLR Link!  Could you add this blurb (I meant to have 
it included but forgot to add it to this admission):
See also "Squeezed from both ends: Decline in Antarctic fur seals in the 
South Shetland Islands driven by both Top–down and Bottom–up processes"

[https://www.ccamlr.org/en/wg-emm-14/39]

We would also like a doi.org assignment for this item once you have it 
archived on NCEI - let me know if you need anything else from me on that.

Thank you!

Hi Stephanie,
I have a quick question about your data package titled "Census of fur seal pups 
at Cape Shirreff, Livingston Island, Antarctica from 1995 to 2012." I see in 
your metadata that you referenced a CCAMLR reference for additional information 
on the 'pup count'. Is that reference something that you would like for me to 
create a link from our geoportal page to? If so, please send me the reference 
information and the link.

I know you just got the accession number, but at your convenience, let me know 
when the InPort pages are finalized please. I will then create the links to 
them as well.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
Lauren
